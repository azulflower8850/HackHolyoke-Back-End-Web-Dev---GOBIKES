# HackHolyoke-Back-End-Web-Dev---GOBIKES
Personal Contribution to 2015 Hack Holyoke, Complete Back-End HTML and Javascript Web Developement for a system that tracked and interacted with bicycles in real time.
This project was done during the Hackathon at Mount Holyoke 2015. THe idea stemmed from Olin College's GoBike System, where the checkout system is primitive notebook and pencil with little maintanence and no supervision.

This web app solves the problem of the GoBikes by providing a brand new online, interactive system that can track all the bikes and allow for various actions. A person can 
check out bikes, see their status, check in bikes, reserve a spot for bikes that are checked out, ping bikers who are taking too long, and even report problems to the manager for repairs.
This is combined with a simple yet easy to understand design that allows for fast, on-the-go checking and tracking for college students who are busy with their everyday lives.

The code is written in javacascript, HTML, and CSS. This repository holds my own code that I wrote for the team, which is the entire back-end web developement, including framing of website and its pages, functions used for the buttons and texts, and travelling between pages and updating data.

The team placed in the top 5 best hacks at HackHolyoke 2015 and won 2nd for the Groupon awards.
